This paper introduces ``CubanSea'' as a cluster-based visualization of search results. The design strictly follows Shneiderman's principle of ``overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand''. Different techniques are combined from existing and novel research for constructing a highly effective design.

Upon searching, the user is presented with a clear overview outlining the topics the result space consists of. The identification of these topics is aided using color encoding and an automated topic header generation. Viewers can then explore the different topics using a dynamically growing column-based list, thus resolving the need for pagination and by filtering this list.
